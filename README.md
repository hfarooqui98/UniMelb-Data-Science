## Welcome!
Hi, this repository is created to give a taste of what the UniMelb undegraduate Data Science major consists of.  
The handbook for the Data Science major can be [viewed here](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2019/components/b-sci-major-8).

For subject content, some of the following are provided:
- Lecture Notes
- Past Exams / MSTs (Crowd-Sourced cohort solutions are also provided for those pesky subjects without exam solutions)
- Textbooks (for a couple subjects)
- Assignments (for the CIS subjects only)
- LaTeX notes for third year subjects
- My old tutoring material 

**The assignments here are meant to be a reference for what you can expect from the subject. If you decide to "borrow" ideas from here (and all other public sources), you will be picked up for plagiarism. You have also been extensively warned at the beginning of each semester.**

If you're from COMP20003 (or any subject that uses the C language), refer to [this guide](https://github.com/akiratwang/COMP20003-Setting-Up) for setting up your Windows 10 device for SSH and WSL.

## Subject Reviews (Pooled from a variety of people)
**Foundations of Computing**:  
- Subject is run well both semesters and is a great introduction to Python and Computer Science.
- Not crammable. If you want to do well, you have to consistently grind and practice it (like maths).
- Consider doing it if you're interested in programming (and it's a better alternative to ENG COMP).

**Foundations of Algorithms**:  
- Introduction to basic sorting algorithms and the C programming language.
- Makes you appreciate memory management in Python because of bloody `malloc` (though `calloc` is better imo).
- Tutors are amazing and can actually teach. (**Shout out to my tutor Alex Zable**).
- Learn to use `valgrind` if you don't want `Segmentation Faults`, and `gdb` to avoid debugging nightmares.

**Elements of Data Processing**:  
- This was **THE** biggest joke of a subject (in a bad way).
- Absolutely no reply from the lecturers / tutors on the discussion forum for weeks.
- Assignments / Labs / Tutorials had little correlation with the lecture content.
- If you know how to use `pandas` and jupyter notebook, **try your hardest** to get this subject waived.
- **Honestly, this is the poorest run subject in the history of subjects. If you really wanted to learn the programming and concepts, head to Research Platform Services @ ERC level 2 and enquire about workshops for Python. That's where I learnt my stuff :)**

**Database Systems**:
- Reneta / David are the lecturers, and both are very clear and passionate about teaching.
- Reneta is actually good once you get used to her accent trust me.
- The theory content is very useful, and the concepts taught are very applicable in real life jobs.
- 1st assignment is a bit iffy since it's a conceptual diagram of an ER-Model
- The intuition will help you for ML, AI, and any Data Science or Data Analytics position.

**Algorithm Data Structures**:
- By far the best 2nd year CIS subject ever (better alternative to Design of Algorithms)
- Goes through all the great algorithms, _including_ path-finding algorithms (unlike DoA which covers hashing and compression instead)
  - For example, the second assignment is usually on path finding and very basic artificial intelligence implementations to solve a `15 puzzle` or to even play `pacman`!
- Assignments are great fun, and after FoA you should (hopefully) be experienced enough in C to appreciate it.
- If you're rusty on C don't worry, first few lectures is revision (we recover `malloc` as well for eng comp kids8)
- The 2018 Exam question about electrical outages landed me a Graduate offer at EssentialEnergy (ayyyy)
- **I highly recommend this subject over Design of Algorithms if you prefer applications of algorithms over the theory!**
- *Students who never had to experience dimefox / nutmeg gonna hate and not appreciate. JupyterLab is so good! (ask the DoA students about their experiences using dimefox and nutmeg trust me)*

**Artificial Intelligence**:
- First third of the lectures are review of basic search algorithms (ADS students will find it a breeze).
- Assignments ARE AMAZINGLY FUN.
- Tutors and lectures are ACTUALLY GOOD.
- Hard and conceptual tutorial questions (although there is no full solution) but are quite useful in expanding your problem solving.
- Notation for Probability (YES PROB IS IN THE SUBJECT) uses logical AND/OR/NOT, so you have been warned.
- If you loved ADS or DoA, you'll love this even more (and it's beneficial to both ML and Applied Data Science)

**Machine Learning:**
- Subject has no maths pre-req, but they did try to attempt to cover "Linear Statistical Models" in 1 lecture.
- The usual lecturer is great, given that the maths is not a pre-req (at least tries to make it interesting). However, he was sick for a vast majority of the time we took the subject so my experience may be a bit more biased to the worse side.
- A lot of content was attempted to be covered and felt a bit too ambitious given that the maths was not pre-req.
- First assignment is a joke if you have done maths, but the second is a **lot more** interesting.
- Quoting my tutor: _"this subject is a money grabber because no one would take this subject if Probability was an actual pre-req"._
- Tim Baldwin got us good for Exam Section D

**Applied Data Science (Capstone Project):**
- A very informative subject to make an overall great learning experience
- Project is very fun and enjoyable if you love applying different techniques you've learnt over the previous subjects
  - Specifically, we had to create a game playing agent to act as a Taxi driver using real world data.
- Group project is very dependent on how good your team works together, so find peers that have a similar work ethic as you!
- **UPDATE: Professor Rao Kotagiri will be the new lecturer!**

**Maths Subjects**:
- They're all well run (except Modern Applied Stats)
- Probability is a big jump (if you didn't do Real Analysis or AM1/AM2) so prepare to grind
- Have yet to find anything bad about the lecturers / lectures and content
- Yao-Ban is the best lecturer (you'll have him for LSM)
- ngl Heejung is still new to lecturing and is honestly lazy. Hopefully she'll take the feedback into account and improve over the years (just you wait until you see the 2019 exam lmao f)

## Final Tips
- I highly recommend you go learn LaTeX, which can be easily done through www.overleaf.com. Not only does it make your assignments look amazing, it's a great way of making great notes and reports (which employers love)
- DO try your best, but WAM isn't everything (I have a mediocre WAM in the 75s) and anything above a 65+ will land you a job provided you network and apply yourself well.
- Try to do projects outside of university. A lot of job offers were as a result of several projects I completed outside of University.
- Be active in your tutorial and labs! It helps the tutor **a lot** and will help you learn better!
